## Student Information System
#### Goal: 
- This repo is all about learning ... Learning Java and TDD from this book: [http://langrsoft.com/books-2/#agileJava]. We examine how Java and TDD integrate throughout the entire development lifecycle, helping to leverage efficient development techniques. We investigate how to translate oral requirements into practical tests, and then how to use those tests to create reliable, high-performance Java code that solves real problems.

- Gain experience using Gradle and Jenkins.
