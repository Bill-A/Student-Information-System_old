## Student Information System
#### Goal: 
- This repo is all about learning ... and re-learning. We will learning Java and TDD from this book: [http://langrsoft.com/books-2/#agileJava]. 
- We will examine how Java and TDD integrate throughout the entire development lifecycle, helping to leverage efficient development techniques. We investigate how to translate oral requirements into practical tests, and then how to use those tests to create reliable, high-performance Java code that solves real problems.

- Additionally, we will be gaining experience using Gradle and Jenkins.
